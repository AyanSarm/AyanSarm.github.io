                    roughly five feet at the show's debut, but sometime between "The Cooler" and "The Pajama War,"
                    he
                    underwent a growth spurt and is currently nearly as tall as Princess Bubblegum.</p>

                    Marceline does not need to drink blood to survive; rather, she consumes the color red, or other
                    similar tints. Marceline is also an avid musician who plays an electric bass guitar, which she
                    crafted from her family's heirloom battle-axe.</p>
